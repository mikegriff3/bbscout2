ratings for NBA, College, G-League, and International\n              teams and players. Our rating system is based on a 20-80 scale and\n              uses a player's per 36 minute stats. This allows a user to quickly\n              discern the impact of a player's stats as well as a player's\n              potential. The rating system also provides more context than\n              traditional stats by giving immediate ranking vs. the top and\n              bottom of the league and allows a user to see ratings relative to\n              other players of the same position. Using uniquely designed graphs\n              and visuals that leverage multiple data visualization techniques,\n              Prodigy provides the simplest and most innovative ways to scout\n              multiple levels of the game. <br />\n              <br />\n              While stats aren't everything, knowing the ins and outs of a\n              player or team's performance can be the edge that seperates\n              winning and losing. Use the search bar or the navigation menu to\n              start scouting.\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-md-6\">\n            <div\n              className=\"how-works-pic\"\n              style={{ padding: \"80px 50px 40px\" }}\n            >\n              <img className=\"img-responsive\" src={Sample} />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div\n          className=\"hr-box\"\n          style={{ backgroundColor: \"rgb(0,0,0)\", padding: \"0 80px\" }}\n        >\n          <hr\n            style={{\n              borderBottom: \"1px solid #eee\",\n              borderTop: \"0px\",\n              margin: \"0\",\n              paddingTop: \"80px\",\n            }}\n          />\n        </div>\n        <div\n          className=\"row\"\n          style={{\n            backgroundColor: \"rgb(0,0,0)\",\n          }}\n        >\n          <div\n            className=\"playfair\"\n            style={{\n              color: \"white\",\n              letterSpacing: \"3px\",\n              fontSize: \"18px\",\n              float: \"right\",\n              padding: \"80px 80px 40px 0px\",\n            }}\n          >\n            MORE THAN STATS\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div\n          className=\"row mts\"\n          style={{\n            backgroundColor: \"rgb(0,0,0)\",\n            padding: \"0px 80px 0px 80px\",\n            //display: \"flex\",\n            alignItems: \"center\",\n          }}\n        >\n          <div className=\"col-md-6 col-xs-12\">\n            <div className=\"mts-pic\">\n              <img className=\"img-responsive\" src={Sample2} />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-md-6 col-xs-12\">\n            <div\n              className=\"mts-text\"\n              style={{\n                color: \"white\",\n              }}\n            >\n              Prodigy does more than stats.
